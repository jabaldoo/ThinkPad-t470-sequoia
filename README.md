   - Disable Secure Boot.
   - Enable AHCI mode.
   - Set DVMT Pre-Allocated to 64MB or higher.

4. **Install macOS**  
   Boot from the USB drive and follow the on-screen instructions to install macOS.

5. **Post-Installation**  
   After installation, mount the EFI partition of your system drive and copy the EFI folder from the USB drive.

## Post-Installation üéâ
- **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth**: Use kexts or replace the Wi-Fi card with a compatible one.
